## Overview
Unlike traditional fashion apps, the Fashion Assistant App includes an interactive fashion assistant that personalizes the shopping experience for each user. Upon registering, users can input their preferred clothing styles, colors, and body measurements (e.g., shoulder size, height). The app generates a personalized avatar, enhancing the interactive experience.

The app's core feature is its intelligent assistant, which suggests products and brands based on each user's profile. Additionally, a chat assistant helps users search for specific items (e.g., "red T-shirt") without the need to browse through all available products.

In its initial phase, the app uses logical functions for matching user preferences with clothing options. Future updates will introduce AI for more advanced search capabilities and the option to recommend clothing based on uploaded images.
